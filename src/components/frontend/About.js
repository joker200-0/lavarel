            <p>Date of last revision: June 2022</p>
            <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY NIKE PLATFORM.</p>
            <p>If you live in any of the following countries or regions, additional terms may apply to you and are viewable at the bottom of these Terms. We display the country/region within the Terms when applicable.  These additional terms override the Terms below to the extent of any inconsistency.</p>
            <p>Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Philippines, all European countries (including specific terms for Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland).</p>
            <p>Welcome to the NIKE community!  You are reading these Terms because you are using a NIKE website, digital experience, social media platform, mobile app, wearable technology, or one of our other products or services, all of which are part of NIKE’s Platform (“Platform”).  You may access the Platform through a computer, mobile phone, tablet, console, or other technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”.  Your carrier's normal rates and fees apply to your Device.</p>
            <p>These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and NIKE and its affiliates (which we may refer to as “NIKE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform. Please review our List of Local Entities for the name of the NIKE entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the appropriate contact information. A few important points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our Terms May Change.  Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer terms, so this paragraph may not apply to you.  [See Canada terms.] We may update these Terms from time to time.  If a material change is made, we will post a notice on the Platform or send you a notification.  Read through any changes, and if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform.  If you continue to use our Platform after we notify you of changes,
                     you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Terms, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</li>
                <li>Terms of Sale.  By making any purchase with us, you also agree to the Terms of Sale that apply in your country or region. [See Hungarian terms.]</li>
                <li>Privacy Policy.  Our Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of personal information on the Platform and applies to your use of the Platform.</li>
                <li>Important Notice for Amateur Athletes.  You are responsible for ensuring that your participation on the Platform does not affect your eligibility as an amateur athlete.  Please check with your amateur athletic association for the rules that apply to you.  NIKE is not responsible or liable for your use of the Platform resulting in your ineligibility as an amateur athlete.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>1. GROUND RULES</p>
            <p>Eligibility.  You are only eligible to use the Platform if you are of legal age in your country/region or if you have consent from your parent or guardian.  There may be certain age restrictions for specific Platform services in various countries or regions.</p>
            <p>Rules for Registration.  When you register for an account with us, the following rules apply:</p>

                <li>Be Responsible:  Inform NIKE immediately of any unauthorized use of your NIKE account.

            </ul>
            <p>2.  OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT</p>
            <p>Except for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our Platform - including text, software, scripts, code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, applications, interactive features, articles, news stories, sketches, animations, stickers, general artwork and other content ("Content") - is owned by NIKE or others we license Content from, and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws. NIKE reserves all rights not expressly described in these Terms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the NIKE name and the Swoosh design) are owned, registered and/or licensed by NIKE.  You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any trademarks, service marks, or trade names through your access or use of the Platform or Content.</li>
                <li>You agree not to change or delete any ownership notices from materials downloaded or printed from the Platform.</li>
                <li>To the extent NIKE approves the download or use of Content comprised of copyrights or copyrightable works, NIKE grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to access and use such copyrights or copyrightable works solely for their intended purpose and solely for as long as NIKE makes such Content generally available to the public. You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Content (including any trademarks or other intellectual property included in the Content), and all such Content is intended for personal, non-commercial use.  NIKE reserves the right to monitor your use and to alter or revoke this license or your access to the Content at any time and for any reason.  NIKE reserves the right to take down any Content in violation of these terms or NIKE’s intellectual property rights.  NIKE allowing you this limited use does not constitute a waiver of any of Nike’s rights to the Content.</li>
                <li>Outside of the specific usage rights granted to you by NIKE in connection with the Platform, you agree not to use, copy, edit, translate, display, distribute, download, transmit, sell, create derivative works of, or in any way exploit any Content, including User Content (unless it is your own User Content that you legally post on the Platform), without NIKE’s prior written consent. Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a breach of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and may subject you to criminal or civil charges and penalties.</li>
